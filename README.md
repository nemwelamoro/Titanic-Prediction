We will be working on the famous titanic dataset that is used to predict the survival of the passengers based on their different attributes (Passenger class, Sex, Age, Fare etc.). Since this a binary classification problem, we would be using Logistic Regression algorithm (a powerful yet simple machine learning algorithm) for creating our model.
Once we have created our final model, we are simply storing this model as a model.sav file (using pickle).
Before creating our django project, first we need to install django into our development machine.
We have created a simple yet powerful ML based django web application that is dynamic in nature (accepts input from user) and make predictions based on Machine Learning model.
